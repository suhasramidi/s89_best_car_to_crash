# Project Title: 
"Crash Test Champions: The Definitive Car Impact Ranking"

# Project Overview:
 This project is a satirical and data-driven platform where users can contribute and view rankings of cars based on their perceived "crashworthiness" or entertainment value in simulated (or imagined) crash scenarios. It's a humorous take on safety ratings, focusing on the spectacle of car crashes rather than actual safety. The goal is to create a database where users can log their opinions and create lists of the best cars to see in a crash.

# Key Features:
User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and contribute rankings and reviews.
Car Database: A database of car makes, models, and years.
Ranking System: Users can rate cars on criteria like "crumple zone spectacle," "airbag theatrics," "overall destruction," and "best for slow motion."
Review System: Users can add humorous reviews and descriptions of imagined crash scenarios.
User-Specific Lists: Users can create and save lists of their favorite "crash test champions."
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific car makes or models.
Image/Video Uploads (Optional): Users could upload images or links to videos of simulated crashes (if feasible and appropriate).

# Tech Stack:
Frontend: React (using Vite), HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose for schema management)
Authentication: Session storage (or optionally Firebase Auth)
Version Control: Git, GitHub
API Testing: Bruno

# Why This Project:
It's a very "silly" and unique idea, fulfilling the project guidelines.
It provides an opportunity to practice full-stack development, including API creation, database interaction, and frontend design.
It allows me to work with user authentication and data manipulation.
It challenges me to create a user interface that's both functional and humorous.
It is a good way to practice user specific data, and lists.
It allows me to practice data entry, and data retreival.
It will allow me to practice image storage if that optional feature is added.
It allows for creative data entry, and user reviews.
